# **A Sociolinguistic route to the characterization and detection of the credibility of events on Twitter**

Following models are used to predict the credibility of events on twitter using socio-linguistic feature with deep learning
models.

**_Folder Description :point_left:_**
-----
 ```
- ./HAN-SL           --> Contains the code of Hierarchical attention network augmented with socio linguistic features 
                          for mutli classsification of credibiltiy.
- ./DPCNN            --> Contains the code word-level DPCNN model
- ./CharCNN          --> Contains the code for char-CNN model.
- ./Linguistic_features --> Contains the code for extracting socio-linguistc features from twitter events data.
```
**_Requirements_**
-----

Make sure to use Python3 when running the scripts. The package requirements can be obtained by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

**_DataSet_**
-----
We consider the largest available dataset,i.e., the CREDBANK corpus for our study. This massive dataset was constructed by iteratively tracking millions of public tweets using Twitterâ€™s streaming API2.The corpus consists of over 66M tweets covering 1,377 events reported on Twitter between October 2014 and February 2015.

**_Models used for our this task_**
-----
We release the code for train/finetuning the following models along with their hyperparamters.
1. **HAN** : This contains basic Hierarchical attention network to detect the credibility of events.Refer to ```HAN-SL``` folder for the    codes and usage instructions.
2. **HAN-SL** : This contains basic Hierarchical attention network augment with socio-linguistic feature calculate using code in            ```Linguistic-features``` folder.Refer to ```HAN-SL``` folder for the codes and usage instructions.
3. **Bi Directional GRU** : This contains BI Direction GRU without any attention layers. Refer to ```GRU-models``` in ```HAN-SL``` for      implementation instructions.
4. **DPCNN**: This contains Deep Pyramid Convolutional Neural Networks for text categorization which we have used for our experiments      also. Refer to ```DPCNN``` folder for for the    codes and usage instructions.
5. **CharCNN**: This contains Character-level Convolutional Neural Networks for text categorization. Refer to ```Char-CNN ``` folder for    for the codes and usage instructions.
